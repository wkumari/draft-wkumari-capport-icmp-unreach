              Captive Portal ICMP Destination Unreachable
                 draft-wkumari-capport-icmp-unreach-01

Abstract

   This document defines a multi-part ICMP extension to ICMP Destination
   Unreachable messages to signal that a user is behind a Captive
   Portal.

   [ Editor note: The IETF is currently discussing improvements in
   captive portal interactions and user experience improvements.  See:
   https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/captive-portals ]

1.  Introduction

   Captive Portals work by blocking (or redirecting) communications
   outside of a "walled garden" until the user has authenticated and /
   or acknowledged an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).  Depending on the
   captive portal implementation, connections other than HTTP will
   either timeout (packets dropped) or meet with a different,
   inaccurate, error condition (like a TCP reset or ICMP Destination
   Unreachable with existing codes).

   A current option for captive portal networks is to reject traffic not
   in the walled garden returning the Destination Unreachable either
   Host or Network Administratively Prohibited.  However, these codes
   are typically permanent policies and do not specifically indicate a
   captive portal is in use.

   This document defines an extension object that can be appended to
   selected multi-part ICMP messages to inform the user that they are
   behind a captive portal.  This informs the user after they have
   attempted an initial connection and is generated by the Captive
   Portal NAS itself.

   [ Editor note: This is complementary, but solves a different problem
   to: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wkumari-dhc-capport-12 -

   wkumari-dhc-capport provides information from a DHCP server (and so
   doesn't need any changes to deployed CPs), and provides information
   *before* the client attempts a connection.  It does not, however,
   have a way of noting that an existing connection has been
   interrupted.]

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  ICMP Dest Unreachable Captive Portal Object

   This document defines an extension object that can be appended to
   selected multi-part ICMP messages ([RFC4884]).  This extension
   permits Captive Portal (CP) NAS devices to inform user devices that
   their connection has been blocked by the Captive Portal NAS.

   The Dest Unreachable Captive Portal Object can be appended to the
   ICMP Destination Unreachable messages.  Figure 1 depicts the Dest
   Unreachable Captive Portal Object.  It must be preceded by an ICMP
   Extension Structure Header and an ICMP Object Header.  Both are
   defined in [RFC4884].

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |W|  Reserved   |         Validity (seconds)                    |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   W  - 1 bit  Warning.  Indicates that the Validity refers to when the
      service will be interrupted.  Note that the "offending" traffic
      was forwarded, not dropped.

   Validity - 24 bits  Time, in seconds, that this result should be
      considered valid (and the OS should not attempt to access the same
      resource in the meantime).

   Editor note / questions.  We are trying to get some feedback on A:
   this general idea and B: this implementation.

      Some open questions.

   W bit or C-Type  We have currently specified a single bit (W) to
      indicate that the remaining lease time is running low, and the the
      connection will be interrupted sometime "soon".  We could,



Bird & Kumari           Expires October 31, 2015                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft     draft-wkumari-capport-icmp-unreach         April 2015


      instead, use a differnt C-Type.  I think a bit is cleaner (and we
      have reserved 7 bits for future flags), but could be convinced
      (or, better yet, bribed) I'm wrong.  Or that the whole "warning"
      idea is a bad one...

   Legacy interaction  If we *do* return e.g ICMP Destination
      Unreachable, Communication Administratively Prohibited to a
      "legacy" (non-Dest Unreachable Captive Portal Object aware) client
      with the 'W' bit set, what happens?  In the testing I did, nothing
      bad seemed to happen, but I *could* see that some hosts may stop
      sending to that address, or...

   General concept  Is this idea useful?

3.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to assign a Class-Num identifier for the Dest
   Unreachable Captive Portal Object from the ICMP Extension Object
   Classes and Class Sub-types registry.

   The IANA is also requested to form and administer the corresponding
   class sub-type (C-Type) space, as follows:

      Dest Unreachable Captive Portal Sub-types:

   0  Reserved.

   1  This message format.

   0x02-0xF6   Available for assignment

   0xF7-0xFF  Reserved for private use

   C-Type values are assignable on a first-come-first-serve (FCFS)
   basis.

   [ Editor note: Currently we are not using the C-Type for anything,
   but I filled this in anyway.  Probably we would overload it at a
   version identifier type thing, but it could also allow further
   extension, for example, a pointer to a status page. ]

4.  Security Considerations

   This method simply annotates existing ICMP Destination Unreachable
   messages to inform users why their connection was blocked.  This
   technique can be used to inform captive portal detection probe
   software that there is a captive portal present (and potentially to
   connect to the URL handed out using draft-wkumari-dhc-capport.  We

Internet-Draft     draft-wkumari-capport-icmp-unreach         April 2015


   anticipate that there will be a new solution devised (such as a well
   known URL / URI on captive portals) to allow the user / captive
   portal probe to do sometyhing more useful with this information.

   From -00 to 01.

   o  Changed the Captive Portal URL to a URI, and specificed that this
      can ONLY contain a path element, which is appened to
      http://<gateway_ip>.  This is to prevent hijacking connections to
      other addresses.
